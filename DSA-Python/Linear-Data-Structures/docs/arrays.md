Array is a collection of items of the same variable type that are stored at contiguous memory locations. It is one of the most popular and simple data structures used in programming.

## Terminologies of Array

- **Array Index:** In an array, elements are identified by their indexes. Array index starts from 0.
- **Array element:** Elements are items stored in an array and can be accessed by their index.
- **Array Length:** The length of an array is determined by the number of elements it can contain. 

## Declaration of Array

### All types of lists are created same way

```
arr = []
```

## Initialization of Array

### This list will store integer type elements
```
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### This list will store character type elements (strings in Python)
```
arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
```

### This list will store float type elements
```
arr = [1.4, 2.0, 24.0, 5.0, 0.0]
```  

_The idea of an array is to represent many instances in one variable._

## Applications of Array Data Structures

- Array is a fundamental data structure and many other data structure are implemented using this. Implementing data structures such as stacks and queues
- Representing data in tables and matrices
- Creating dynamic data structures such as Hash Tables and Graph.
- When compared to other data structures, arrays have the advantages like random access (we can quickly access i-th item) and cache friendliness (all items are stored at contiguous location)

## Types of Arrays

Arrays can be classified in two ways:
1. On the basis of Size
2. On the basis of Dimensions

## Types of Arrays on the basis of Size:

1. Fixed Sized Arrays:
